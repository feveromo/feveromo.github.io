  <h1>Privacy Policy for Cindra</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 26, 2025</p>

  <p><strong>Cindra</strong> is a Chrome extension that summarizes content from YouTube videos, Reddit posts, and general web pages using user-selected AI models.</p>

  <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Website Content:</strong> Cindra reads website content such as video transcripts, Reddit posts/comments, and page text only for the purpose of summarization. This content is not stored, sold, or shared outside the context of summarization.</li>
    <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Cindra saves settings like your chosen AI model, theme, and custom prompts locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. This data is not transmitted elsewhere.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What We Donâ€™t Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect personal information such as your name, email, IP address, or browsing history.</li>
    <li>We do not collect health, financial, or authentication data.</li>
    <li>We do not track your activity outside the specific content you choose to summarize.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
  <p>Cindra uses website content only to summarize it using AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and others. The extracted content is sent directly to the selected AI service in a new tab for processing. We do not store or transmit this data elsewhere.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>Cindra does not share any user data with third parties. The only interaction is between your browser and the AI service you select (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini), which operates under its own privacy policy.</p>

  <h2>Remote Code</h2>
  <p>Cindra does not use remote code. All functionality is contained within the extension package.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>For any questions or concerns, contact <a href="https://github.com/feveromo" target="_blank">feveromo on GitHub</a>.</p>
